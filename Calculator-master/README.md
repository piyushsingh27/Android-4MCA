## How to Use
- Calculator functions in BASIC mode, single operation at a time
- Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Clear Display, Decimals
- Linear Layout used for both portrait and landscape orientations
- Using Negative Sign before a number to allow for negative citations
- Brackets append to display but do not function as expected
- Pressing Decimal twice will ignore the decimal key

## Future Goals
- Implement proper use case for brackets
- Implement FORMULA mode to allow display to show multiple operands and operations
